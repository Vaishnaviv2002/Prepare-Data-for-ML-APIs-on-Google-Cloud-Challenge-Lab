# Prepare Data for ML APIs on Google Cloud – Challenge Lab

## Overview
This repository contains an **automation script** to support learners in completing the  
**“Prepare Data for ML APIs on Google Cloud” Challenge Lab**.  

The script helps automate repetitive steps such as:
- Creating BigQuery datasets and tables
- Setting up Cloud Storage buckets
- Enabling APIs and generating API keys
- Running Dataflow pipelines  

This allows learners to focus on **understanding how the services interact**, rather than spending time on manual configuration.
